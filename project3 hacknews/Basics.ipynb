    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",

    "\n",
    "So we will compare these two types of posts to determine if **Ask HN** or **Show HN** reveive more comments and whether posts get more comments at a certain time."
